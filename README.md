# KiviPaperiSakset/RockPaperScissors

The assignment was in Finnish and so is the program. 

The assignment was to "fix an amateur programmers attempt at making a rock, paper, scissors program"

The broken code is resides in the main.java file, but it has been commented out. The logic for the game was moved to a new called class Matsi.java

Matsi (Match) class houses the logic for the game, and Pelaala (Player) class houses the players choice, wins and other useful methods.
